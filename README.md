# Hack-RU-Fall-2023-Skinspect
We created a Skin Tumor Classification model that can detect whether your tumor is malignant or benign! We did this in the HackRU 2023 Fall Hackathon and ended up getting Runer Up in the Health Category. There are issues in the code of course and not everything is perfect, but we wish to improve upon this idea in the future and continue this project!
